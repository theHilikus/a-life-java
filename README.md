# A Computational Exploration of Artificial Life (Java) ðŸ”¬ðŸŒ±

This project explores the fascinating dynamics of artificial life by simulating a world inhabited by diverse agents. Inspired by the principles of natural selection, these agents interact, compete, and evolve over time.

## The World
This Java-based simulation models a dynamic environment where agents with distinct characteristics interact and evolve. It provides a platform to observe how complex system-level behaviours can arise from relatively simple individual rules.

## Agents
The heart of this simulation lies in the agents, each endowed with a unique set of genes. These genes influence their behaviour, appearance and interactions with the environment.

### Interactions
Agents engage in a variety of interactions:
* **Plants:** These static organisms serve as the foundation of the food chain, providing sustenance and gradually regenerating.
* **Herbivores:** These mobile agents exhibit a range of behaviours, including resting, foraging, feeding, mating, and navigating the world based on their needs and instincts.

### Evolutionary Forces
* **Reproduction:** Agents reproduce, passing on their genetic information to their offspring.
* **Mutations:** Occasional mutations introduce genetic variations within the population, driving the evolutionary process.
* **Natural Selection:** The fittest agents, those best adapted to their environment, are more likely to survive and reproduce, leading to the gradual evolution of the population.

## Visualization
See it in action! There are two ways to visualize the simulation:

### Text-based
Experience the simulation through a minimal text-based interface.

### Graphical (Java Swing)
Immerse yourself in a visually rich representation of the world.

#### Agent appearance
* Background color: Reflects the agent's current mood based on its needs
* Background transparency: Indicates the agent's vitality (energy and hunger levels).
* Border thickness: Represents the agent's age (thin: young, thick: adult, gray: old).
* Blue square around an agent: Represents the agent's field of vision.

#### Agent details: A Window into Individual Lives
Gain deeper insights into the agents' internal states by tracking their attributes at each simulation tick. This window provides a detailed view of individual agent behaviour and how it changes over time.
